# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This repository serves as the single source of truth for how OctoAcme delivers customer-centric features and services through structured, transparent, and iterative processes.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to support cross-functional teams in delivering high-quality work with clarity and consistency. Our approach begins with robust **initiation**—clarifying business need, defining success metrics, and ensuring stakeholder alignment—before moving into detailed **planning** with prioritized, shippable increments, clear backlogs, and proactive risk management. This foundation enables teams to understand the "why" and "what" before diving into execution.

During **execution**, we rely on daily standups, weekly syncs, and demo reviews to maintain momentum and surface blockers early. Our project board workflow supports continuous delivery while keeping all stakeholders informed. Quality assurance is deeply embedded in our process: automated and manual testing, rigorous code reviews, security scans, and milestone-based retrospectives are standard practices that ensure we deliver reliable, secure, and maintainable solutions. Every release follows a disciplined deployment process with clear rollback plans and post-deployment verification.

Distinct **roles** drive accountability across the project lifecycle. Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize backlogs, and measure success; Developers implement features with a focus on quality and testability; and QA/Testing teams validate acceptance criteria. Each role has focused rhythms and responsibilities, supported by communication templates and incident protocols that keep all parties informed from kickoff through delivery and continuous improvement.

All of our practices emphasize **transparency**, **psychological safety**, and **iterative, data-driven improvement**. We celebrate learnings, encourage candid feedback in retrospectives, and continuously refine our processes based on evidence and team insights. This documentation exists to help new and existing team members quickly understand OctoAcme's approach and find detailed guidance for every phase of the project lifecycle.
